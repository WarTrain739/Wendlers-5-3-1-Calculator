This app calculates lifting goals for anyone using Wendler's 5-3-1 weight lifting program. The app also rounds calculated weights to the nearest number divisible by 2.5 and 5 to reflect possible weights found in a gym.
Currently working on adding a menu to give the user more options to compare their data with worldwide standards.
Still learning how to use razor pages to turn the calculator into a web app.
